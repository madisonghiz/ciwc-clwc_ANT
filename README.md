# ciwc-clwc_ANT

## About

Using Jupyter notebook to retrieve, manipulate, and display the atmospheric profile (surface - ~10km, 1000 hPa - ~650 hPa) of cloud ice water content (ciwc) and cloud liquid water content (clwc) over West Antarctica. 

These parameters are the mass (g) of cloud liquid water droplets or cloud ice particles per kilogram of the total mass of moist air.

End result are plots with daily and spatially averaged vertical profile over desired location (SDM), during specific melt events specified by user input. 

## Data

Atmospheric reanalysis data from ECMWF's ERA5 dataset are used (hourly increments). Download from Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store.

Example file can be downloaded using ERA5 API. Example input is Siple Dome January 2016. Region bounds: lat(-81, -82.5), lon(-144.914,-155).
